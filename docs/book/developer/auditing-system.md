# Auditing System

Auditing is primarily generating audit logs by different Paralus
components to provide top notch information of what all happened
inside. Paralus core, Relay server and Prompt are the producers of the
auditing logs, which later processed and provided to the client by
Paralus core itself. The intermediate service is used to store the
logs.

Let's go through different entities involved in auditing system one by
one.

## Producers

It generate the audit log on each event occurred in the system, for
example user made changes to the cluster. The generated log are in a
well defined JSON formatted structure. The application which generate
the log or a sidecar container is responsible for writing audit log to
stdout.

## Log processors

It pulls logs generated by producers and stored to auditlog storage
configured. Some examples of log processors are Fluent-bit, Filebeat
which are used in Paralus helm chart. It ships the logs from producers
to the storage.

## Storage

Storage persists the audit logs so that they are available across
lifecycle of application. Some examples are Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL
database. The log processor should properly plug to the storage that
you are using.

## Consumers

The consumer reads audit logs from the storage and provided to the
client via API. Paralus core has functionality to consume audit logs
and make it available to the clients.
